# DK Redis Sample Project

This project is a basic example of using Redis.

To use Redis, you must first install <a href="https://redis.io/downloads">Redis</a> on your local computer or another machine. 
Once installed, you can access Redis through its IP address and port number (the default port is 6379).

Also you need to install the Redis package with the command below:

```
Install-Package StackExchange.Redis
```
